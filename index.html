          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>June 19, 1909</b>: Tsushima Shuuji (Dazai’s real name) was born in
              Kanagi village, Northern Tsugaru District, Aomori Prefecture. He
              was the eighth surviving child of Tsushima Gen'emon and his wife
              Tane.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1909-1923</b>: Shuuji rarely saw his parents and didn’t have much of a
              relationship with them as he was raised mostly by his aunt and a
              nursemaid, Take-san (from his book Tsugaru). His family was
              wealthy and his father was a local politician. Shuuji was always
              at the top of his class in elementary school.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1923</b>: entered middle school, his father died and his eldest
              brother, Bunji, took over as head of the household.
            </li>
            <li>1925: published his first story in a school magazine.</li>
            <li>
              <b>1927</b>: entered Hirosaki Higher School. Akutagawa commits suicide
              which causes Shuuji to neglect his studies and devote himself to
              writing. He spends money on local hot springs and geisha. He met
              Oyama Hatsuyo, an apprentice geisha who would later become his
              first wife.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1929</b>: wrote a novella, One Generation of Landowners, which
              centered on the poor treatment of farm hands by wealthy land
              owners, and the family in his novella had a lot of resemblances to
              his own family. The night before final exams at his high school,
              Shuuji tried to overdose on Calmotin ( a sleeping medication). He
              spent time at the hot springs to recover, but while he was there
              many of his leftist-oriented friends were arrested and expelled
              from school.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>1930</b>: Shuuji graduated and enrolled in the French Literature
              Department at Tokyo Imperial University. He roomed near his
              brother, Keiji. Shuuji began donating money to the Communist
              Party. Keiji died of tuberculosis, and Shuuji stops attending
              school. Hatsuyo runs away to Tokyo where Shuuji meets her and they
              want to get married, much to Bunji’s dislike. Bunji agrees to let
              them marry, but Shuuji is formally expelled from the family. Nine
              days after being expelled he and Tanabe Shimeko, a waitress who
              worked in Ginza, attempt a lover’s suicide, but only Shimeko dies.
              His family stepped in to keep him out of jail for attempted
              murder. Shuuji and Hatsuyo are married in Tsugaru.
